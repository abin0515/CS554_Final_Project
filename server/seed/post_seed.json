I started by establishing a consistent schedule: bath, book, and lullaby at the same time every night. I also used a white noise machine and dim lighting to signal it's time for sleep.\r\n\r\nThe biggest game changer? A swaddle and a simple technique called the \"pause\" â€” instead of rushing in at the first stir, I waited a few moments to see if my baby could settle himself. By week two, he was sleeping 6â€“7 hours straight!\r\n\r\nEvery baby is different, but I hope this gives other parents some hope and ideas",
